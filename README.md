## General info

The program is a classic game of Pong. Two players, each with a paddle, try to hit the ball to score points. The program is using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies to train the AI, so that user can play by himself.

For the moment, in order to play a game with AI, you need to make changes in code:
- uncomment the "play_ai" function,
- comment "run_neat" function.

## Future

I plan to add things such as:
- main menu to choose from options:
	- teach AI
	- play vs AI
	- play vs another player
- more diversity to the game like pick-up bonuses or increasing speed of the ball
- choosing from AI difficulty
